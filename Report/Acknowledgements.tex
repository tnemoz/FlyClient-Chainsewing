We thank Andrianna Polydouri and Dionysis Zindros for having discovered the \cs\ attacks and having shared with us the principles of the attack against Superblock NiPoPoW, which allowed us to design the attack against \FC.

We'd like to thank particularly Alexei Zamyatin, not only for having reread this report and pointed out our mistakes, but also, and most importantly, for his patience and his rigour as a supervisor. He put us back on the right track numerous times and we learned more from him than he learned from us.
